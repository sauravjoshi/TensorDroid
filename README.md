# TensorDroid
My first tensorflow android app

Scripts folder contains the python files for :- <br>
Firstly creating a simple model and saving its computation graph and after demo training saving the values into checkpoint file.
Seconfly turning two of these files to a single standalone file, which we can use inside the Android application.
